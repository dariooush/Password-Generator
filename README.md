# Password-Generator
This is my Password Generator with Python

I have worte this app in Python and it runs in Terminal.
You can use it with any code editor like VSCode or etc.

In this app you can set some characters by your choice to be generate in the random password.
You can specify how many password and how length of characters you want to be generated.

It's simple and I hope to be usefull.

Good Luck.
